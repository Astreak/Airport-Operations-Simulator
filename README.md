Airport Management System is a comprehensive microservice architecture is an expected emulation of airport operations, ranging from cab services to Air Traffic Control (ATC). This project is implemented using Node.js and React.js, with MongoDB handling real-time status data retrieval and PostgreSQL managing the main user database.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The backend is developed using Node.js, providing a scalable and efficient runtime environment.
- **React.js**: The frontend is built with React.js, delivering a modern and interactive user interface.
- **MongoDB**: Real-time status data is stored and retrieved using MongoDB, offering flexibility and high performance.
- **PostgreSQL**: The main user database is managed by PostgreSQL, providing reliability and robustness.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication powered by PostgreSQL ensures data integrity.
- **Real-Time Status Updates**: MongoDB is utilized for real-time updates on airport operations, including flight statuses and gate assignments.
- **Interactive UI**: The React.js frontend provides an engaging and user-friendly experience for airport staff and administrators.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built on Node.js, the backend is designed to handle the scale and complexity of airport operations.
